ERRORS/BUGS:
    - promotion
      if a piece is taken, promotion does not work

    - pieces jumping over pieces

SOLVED:
    - 1/2 of the en passant problem
      stopped en passant from working as the piece being taken would not be removed from the board
      caused by a maths error
      fixed by subtracting 2 from the maths (at the point where the pawn was removed rather than at the point where the variable was declared)

    - promotion problem
      problems with promotion including the piece not appearing
      about line 140 - about line 180
      fixed by appending to pieces

FINISHED:
    - piece movement
      queen, king, knight, bishop, pawn

    - display
      display of the board and pieces

TO ADD:
    - castling

    - checks & checkmate

NOTES:
  - I & J variables
    The "i" coordinate = x coordinate
    The "j" coordinate = y coordinate
